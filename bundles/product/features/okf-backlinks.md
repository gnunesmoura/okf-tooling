# Feature - OKF Backlinks

## Objective

Help people, scripts, and skills answer one question for a resolved concept: which other concepts reference it in the current OKF bundle.

## Scope

- `tooling okf backlinks [<bundle>] <concept-id-or-path> [--json]` resolves one concept and lists incoming links to it.
- The command uses the shared bundle discovery and target resolution rules.
- The command reuses the same link extraction and normalization rules as `tooling okf links`, including ignoring fenced code blocks and inline code spans during semantic analysis.
- The result is concept-scoped and ordered deterministically.
- Broken or unresolved references are reported as tolerated issues, not fatal failures.
- JSON output uses the shared envelope and places the backlinks payload in `data`.
- Human output stays concise and path-first.
- Raw content display remains the responsibility of `tooling okf show` and is not altered by backlink scanning.

## Out of Scope

- Outbound link discovery belongs to `tooling okf links`.
- Structural browsing belongs to `tooling okf tree`.
- Concept inventory belongs to `tooling okf list`.
- Concept body reading belongs to `tooling okf show`.
- Link rewriting, editing, and automatic repair are out of scope.
- Validation and health scoring are out of scope.

## User Flow

1. A user provides a bundle path or lets the CLI discover the bundle.
2. The CLI resolves the requested concept by the documented `show` precedence.
3. The CLI collects incoming references that target the resolved concept outside fenced code blocks and inline code spans.
4. The CLI renders a compact human view or a stable JSON payload.
5. The CLI includes tolerated read issues without failing the command unless the bundle cannot be read.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `tooling okf backlinks <bundle> <concept>` returns only references that target the resolved concept.
- The command accepts concept IDs and bundle-relative paths as target forms.
- The command fails deterministically when the target cannot be resolved.
- The output is stable across repeated runs for the same bundle state.
- References embedded inside fenced code blocks and inline code spans are ignored by backlink discovery.
- JSON mode includes the resolved concept and the backlink payload in `data`.
- Tolerated link or read issues appear in `issues` without forcing command failure.
- The command does not invent references that are not present in the bundle read model.
- The command uses the same target-resolution precedence as `show`.

## Minimum Tests

- Resolves a concept by concept ID.
- Resolves a concept by bundle-relative path.
- Returns multiple incoming references for a concept with more than one backlink.
- Returns an empty backlink list for a concept with no inbound references.
- Ignores backlink candidates inside inline code spans.
- Ignores backlink candidates inside fenced code blocks.
- Preserves deterministic ordering of backlink results.
- Emits stable JSON for the resolved concept payload.
- Preserves tolerated issues without failing the command.
- Fails cleanly when the target concept cannot be resolved.
