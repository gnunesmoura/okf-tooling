Implement `props` as a thin projection over the existing resolver, inventory,
and normalized `Concept` records. Planned source areas are the repository
paths in `related.source_paths`; they are areas to inspect or extend, not
evidence of completed work. Do not alter the OKF parser's meaning or add a
second read model.

## Technical Contracts

- The command uses the shared bundle resolution and scan path.
- The supported field contract is the ordered set `type`, `title`,
  `description`, `tags`.
- JSON uses the existing top-level `ok`, `command`, `bundle`, `data`, and
  `issues` envelope. `data` contains selected `fields`, ordered `rows`, and
  row metadata only if needed by the established conventions.
- Human output is concise and path-first; table columns follow selection
  order. CSV has a header and escaped cells according to the standard library.
- Rows sort by `concept_id`, independent of filesystem traversal order.
- Tags preserve source list order; scalar missing fields are null in JSON and
  empty in table/CSV. Unknown explicit fields are an input error.
- Tolerated concept issues remain in the shared issue channel and do not
  silently remove readable rows.

## Source and Test Boundaries

Inspect `src/tooling/okf/read_model.py` and `models.py` for normalized fields,
`src/tooling/okf/commands.py` and `src/tooling/cli.py` for command wiring, and
the existing `tests/test_*.py` patterns for fixtures and CLI assertions.
Create or extend `tests/test_props.py` only as implementation requires. Do
not modify PRDs, features, architecture concepts, indexes, or roadmaps as
part of implementation unless a later approved task explicitly requires it.

## Decisions

1. Reuse normalized fields rather than exporting arbitrary raw frontmatter;
   this keeps unknown producer keys preserved by the reader but outside this
   bounded projection.
2. Reject unknown explicit selections rather than silently dropping columns;
   a typo must be visible to scripts and humans.
3. Sort by `concept_id` and preserve requested field order so repeated exports
   are comparable.
4. Keep read issues visible and non-fatal when the concept remains readable,
   consistent with [Output and Errors](../../../architecture/output-and-errors.md).

## Risks and Mitigations

- Output drift: assert exact envelopes, headers, ordering, and empty values.
- Parser duplication: keep projection logic downstream of `read_model`.
- Mixed frontmatter regressions: use fixtures with missing, unknown, and
  malformed-but-readable metadata.
- CLI compatibility: add only the planned command and format/field options;
  preserve existing commands and exit semantics.

No implementation, test result, or validation is claimed by this draft plan.
