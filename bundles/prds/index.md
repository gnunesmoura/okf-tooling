# PRDs

Product requirements and product decisions for `tooling`.

## SDD role

PRDs are normative for product intent, scope, and requirements: read them to
understand why a change exists and what outcome it must achieve. Phase notes
or completed implementation requirements remain contextual history; current
change execution state belongs in a future change package.
