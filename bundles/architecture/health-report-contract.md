# Health Report Contract

## Scope and Context

`health` should give a compact status view for one OKF bundle without becoming a second validator, crawler, fixer, or scoring system. It depends on the shared resolver, shared read model, shared issue contract, shared JSON envelope, and the validation report semantics already defined for readable bundles. The command is profile-based so the default view stays short while broader quality groups remain opt-in.

Health evaluation must ignore content inside fenced code blocks and inline code spans before looking for links, headings, or other signals, so examples and snippets do not create false positives.

The OKF specification separates required conformance from soft quality guidance. Concepts require parseable top-of-file YAML frontmatter and a non-empty `type`; present reserved files must follow `index.md` and `log.md` structure; missing optional fields, unknown types, unknown keys, missing `index.md`, broken cross-links, and missing citations must be tolerated by consumers.

Health therefore needs to expose useful quality signals while preserving the permissive OKF consumption model.

## Payload and Behavior Contract

`tooling okf health` is a read-only report over the existing bundle read result, validation summary, and link extraction data.

The command should:

- resolve one bundle through the shared discovery rules;
- read the bundle through the shared OKF read model;
- reuse validation report semantics for conformance status and issue counts;
- use the shared top-level JSON envelope with `command: "okf.health"`;
- place only the health report in `data`;
- declare the selected profile and the evaluated versus ignored rule groups in `data`;
- keep read, validation, and health collection issues in the shared top-level `issues` array;
- treat poor health signals as report data, not command execution failure;
- avoid external URL fetching, citation target verification, historical trend analysis, and opaque scoring;
- sort all path-like detail lists by normalized bundle-relative path and all name-like lists by normalized name.

The canonical rule-group IDs are strings, ordered as `inventory`, `reserved_files`, `links`, `indexes`, `logs`, `metadata`, `citations`, and `connectivity`. `rules.evaluated_groups` and `rules.ignored_groups` contain these string IDs, not objects. Validation is reported separately in `data.validation`, not as a rule group. `quick` evaluates `inventory`, `reserved_files`, `links`, and `connectivity`; `full` evaluates all canonical groups.

The JSON envelope remains:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "command": "okf.health",
  "bundle": {},
  "data": {},
  "issues": []
}
```

The `data` payload should use this stable shape:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "profile": "quick",
    "evaluated_groups": [],
    "ignored_groups": []
  },
  "status": "ok",
  "summary": {
    "status": "ok",
    "validation_passed": true,
    "concept_count": 0,
    "directory_count": 0,
    "warning_signal_count": 0,
    "error_signal_count": 0
  },
  "validation": {
    "passed": true,
    "status": "pass",
    "issue_count": 0,
    "error_count": 0,
    "warning_count": 0,
    "info_count": 0,
    "checked_file_count": 0
  },
  "inventory": {
    "concept_count": 0,
    "directory_count": 0,
    "reserved_file_count": 0,
    "index_file_count": 0,
    "log_file_count": 0,
    "concept_types": []
  },
  "reserved_files": {
    "root_index_present": false,
    "root_log_present": false,
    "index_issue_count": 0,
    "log_issue_count": 0,
    "malformed_reserved_file_count": 0,
    "malformed_reserved_file_paths": []
  },
  "links": {
    "internal_link_count": 0,
    "resolved_internal_link_count": 0,
    "broken_internal_link_count": 0,
    "external_link_count": 0,
    "concepts_with_broken_internal_links_count": 0,
    "concepts_with_broken_internal_links": []
  },
  "indexes": {
    "directory_count": 0,
    "directories_with_index_count": 0,
    "directories_without_index_count": 0,
    "directories_without_index": [],
    "listed_content_count": 0,
    "unlisted_content_count": 0,
    "unlisted_content_paths": []
  },
  "logs": {
    "log_file_count": 0,
    "newest_entry_date": null,
    "malformed_date_heading_count": 0,
    "ordering_issue_count": 0,
    "log_paths_with_issues": []
  },
  "metadata": {
    "fields": []
  },
  "citations": {
    "concepts_with_citations_count": 0,
    "concepts_with_external_links_count": 0,
    "external_linked_without_citations_count": 0,
    "external_linked_without_citations": []
  },
  "connectivity": {
    "concepts_with_internal_links_count": 0,
    "concepts_without_inbound_count": 0,
    "concepts_without_outbound_count": 0,
    "orphan_concept_count": 0,
    "orphan_concepts": []
  }
}
```

`status` and `summary.status` use the same stable values:

- `ok` when validation passes and there are no warning or error health signals in the evaluated groups;
- `attention` when validation passes but soft health signals are present in the evaluated groups;
- `invalid` when validation does not pass.

`summary.warning_signal_count` and `summary.error_signal_count` count only warning and error health signals from the evaluated rule groups. They exclude ignored groups and exclude validation issues, which remain summarized separately in `data.validation` and the top-level `issues` array.

Health signal counts are derived from the grouped report fields, not from the top-level `issues` array. They summarize report concerns from the evaluated rule groups such as broken internal links, malformed reserved files, missing recommended metadata, missing indexes, log ordering issues, external links without detectable citations, and orphan concepts. Ignored groups must be declared explicitly so agents can distinguish omitted checks from poor health.

`reserved_files` booleans only describe root `index.md` and root `log.md` presence. `index_issue_count`, `log_issue_count`, `malformed_reserved_file_count`, and `malformed_reserved_file_paths` cover reserved-file issues for present reserved files anywhere in the bundle.

`inventory.concept_types` contains objects shaped as:

```json
{ "type": "ArchitectureDecision", "count": 0 }
```

Sort concept type entries by `type`. Concepts with missing or unreadable type values should be represented with a stable placeholder such as `"<missing>"` only when they are present in the readable model.

`metadata.fields` contains one object for each recommended optional frontmatter field: `title`, `description`, `resource`, `tags`, and `timestamp`.

```json
{
  "field": "title",
  "present_count": 0,
  "missing_count": 0,
  "missing_concepts": []
}
```

Sort metadata field entries in the fixed order above. Sort `missing_concepts` by `concept_id`. Missing recommended fields are health signals only; they must not be promoted to validation issues.

Index coverage is based on detectable markdown links in present `index.md` files. Missing `index.md` files are reported as discoverability signals, not validation failures. `listed_content_count` and `unlisted_content_count` count bundle contents that can reasonably be matched to concepts or child directories in the corresponding directory scope. Implementations should not infer failures from prose-only index entries that cannot be resolved as links.

Log freshness is based on present `log.md` date headings. `newest_entry_date` is the newest valid `YYYY-MM-DD` heading found across logs, or `null` when no valid log date exists. Malformed date headings and newest-first ordering issues should align with validation reserved-file checks, but health may aggregate their counts and affected paths for compact display.

Citation detection is intentionally mechanical. A concept has citations when its body contains a markdown heading exactly named `Citations`, case-insensitive after trimming heading markers and surrounding whitespace. A concept with one or more external links and no detectable citations section is a health signal, not a validation issue.

Connectivity is based only on internal concept-to-concept links. External links, reserved-file links, and broken links do not create inbound or outbound connectivity for concepts. An orphan concept is one with no inbound and no outbound resolved internal concept link.

Human output should start with the resolved bundle path, selected profile, and the stable health status, then group only the selected signal families. It should remain concise and path-first, with detail paths shown only where they make the status actionable.

Process failure remains reserved for unreadable bundle paths, discovery ambiguity, invalid CLI input, and unexpected execution errors. A readable bundle with validation failures or poor health signals still uses the success envelope with `ok: true`; the bundle state is expressed by `data.rules`, `data.status`, `data.validation`, grouped health fields, and top-level `issues`.

## Consequences

- `health` stays an aggregate projection over existing OKF domain data instead of introducing a separate parser or stricter conformance model.
- Automation gets a stable payload for compact bundle status without scraping human output.
- Soft OKF guidance remains visible without violating the specification's tolerant consumption rules.
- Validation remains authoritative for conformance; health only summarizes and complements it.
- The contract intentionally reports counts and sorted detail lists instead of scores, grades, or historical trends.
- Some signals are heuristic by design, especially citation detection and index coverage, so they must remain non-fatal and mechanically explainable.
- Large bundles may produce long detail lists, but the lists are deterministic and belong in JSON; human output can stay compact.

## Invariants

Health is read-only, validation remains authoritative for conformance, ignored rule groups are explicit, and health signals never turn a readable bundle into a command execution failure.

## Alternatives Considered

A single numeric health score was rejected because it would hide which OKF signals matter and create arbitrary weighting.

Failing the command for poor health was rejected because the OKF specification requires consumers to tolerate missing optional fields, missing indexes, broken cross-links, and incomplete citation coverage.

Embedding validation issues inside `data.validation` was rejected because the shared envelope already defines top-level `issues` as the issue channel.

Fetching external links to verify citations was rejected because `health` must stay local, deterministic, fast, and independent of network access.

Reporting only counts was rejected because deterministic detail paths are needed for actionable human output and scriptable remediation, while still keeping the contract smaller than a full lint report.

## Compatibility Rules

Reuse the shared resolver, read model, issue channel, semantic normalization, and JSON envelope. Add future signal groups without changing the meaning of validation or existing top-level response fields.
