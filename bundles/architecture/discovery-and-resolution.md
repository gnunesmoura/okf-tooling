# Discovery and Resolution

## Context

Bundle discovery and target lookup are shared concerns for every command that reads an OKF bundle. This document is authoritative for candidate selection, ambiguity handling, target precedence, and bundle-relative identity normalization.

## Decision

### Shared Resolver

The CLI should use one shared bundle resolution path for `tree`, `list`, `show`, and future OKF commands.

Keep the discovery rules, ambiguity formatting, and bundle-relative path normalization in the shared resolver instead of reimplementing them in command handlers.

### Bundle Discovery

When `<bundle>` is provided, treat it as a path to a bundle root directory and resolve it relative to the current working directory when needed.

When `<bundle>` is omitted, inspect the current directory tree in deterministic path order:

1. check the current directory itself;
2. walk its descendant directories;
3. treat every directory that matches the bundle-root rule as a candidate.

A directory is a candidate bundle root if it contains either:

- `index.md`, or
- at least one non-reserved `.md` file with parseable OKF frontmatter.

This lets discovery distinguish between:

- the current directory being the bundle root; and
- the current directory containing a nested bundle root inside one of its folders.

If more than one candidate exists, fail deterministically and print each candidate with a reference command, for example:

```text
More than one OKF bundle found. Provide the path explicitly:
- artifacts/ -> tooling okf tree artifacts --depth 2 --summary
- tooling/bundles/ -> tooling okf tree tooling/bundles --depth 2 --summary
```

Use a stable error code for this condition, such as `OKF_DISCOVERY_AMBIGUOUS`.

### Show Resolution

`show` should resolve targets in this order:

1. exact `concept_id` match;
2. bundle-relative path with `.md` normalized;
3. bundle-relative file path.

If a target still cannot be resolved, return a single not-found error for that target rather than falling back to a different interpretation.

### Normalization

Normalize all bundle-relative paths with `/` separators, derive `concept_id` from the relative file path without `.md`, and use the normalized identity everywhere the CLI renders or compares concepts.

## Consequences

All commands use the same deterministic bundle and concept identity rules, so an ambiguous discovery result or target lookup cannot silently resolve differently by command.

## Alternatives Considered

Command-specific discovery and fallback resolution were rejected because they would produce inconsistent candidates, target precedence, and rendered identities.
