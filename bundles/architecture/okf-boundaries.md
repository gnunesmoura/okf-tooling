# OKF Boundaries

## Context

The architecture separates reusable OKF reading from CLI concerns so the local MVP remains small while its read model and contracts can support later commands. These boundaries are authoritative for ownership and prohibited cross-layer behavior.

## Decision

### Library

Own the domain model, bundle discovery, identity normalization, inventory, parsing, query resolution, and issue aggregation.

### CLI

Own command parsing, exit codes, user-facing formatting, and JSON selection.

### Models

Keep typed contracts only. Do not read files or format output in model classes.

### Discovery

Find a bundle from an explicit path or from the current directory using a small, deterministic search order. Discovery must produce one root or one ambiguity error, never an implied fallback.

### Parsing

Read YAML frontmatter and markdown bodies permissively. Do not reject bundles because of unknown keys or unknown `type` values. Preserve raw frontmatter separately from normalized fields.

### Serialization

Centralize stable human and JSON output. Do not let commands invent their own JSON shapes or sort rules.

### Errors

Use a single envelope for fatal command failures. Keep tolerated content problems as `Issue` records attached to the read model. The envelope must be shared by all commands.

## Consequences

Commands stay thin, domain behavior remains reusable, and tolerated content issues can travel through the same read model without being turned into command-specific failures.

## Alternatives Considered

Letting command handlers own parsing, discovery, and output was rejected because it would duplicate rules and make contracts diverge.
