# Authority and Constraints

Follow repository policy and the [OKF specification](../../references/Open%20Knowledge%20Format%20Specification.md) first, then product intent in the
[spec](spec.md), technical boundaries in the [plan](plan.md), and implemented
behavior in source and tests. Record conflicts; do not silently redefine an
existing contract.

## Allowed Work

- Implement only CHANGE-001's read-only projection and its tests.
- Use the existing resolver, read model, issue semantics, and output envelope.
- Modify only the planned source/test areas unless a directly required narrow
  dependency is documented in the plan.

## Invariants

- Never write or mutate bundle files or frontmatter.
- Support only `type`, `title`, `description`, and `tags`.
- Reject explicitly selected unknown fields.
- Keep rows sorted by `concept_id`, selected fields in request order, and tags
  in source order.
- Preserve readable concepts and tolerated issues under mixed frontmatter.
- Do not create a props PRD, feature, schema, release work, or speculative
  package artifact.

## Validation and Closeout Evidence

Run the focused and full unittest commands in [acceptance tests](acceptance-tests.md), inspect exact
outputs for all acceptance checks, run available structural/link checks, and
run `git diff --check`. Closeout must identify changed source/test files,
commands and results, edge-case evidence, and any unresolved risk. A status
change to `implemented` or `validated` requires actual implementation or
passing acceptance evidence respectively; this draft package claims neither.
