# Observable Checks

Each check is expected to be run after implementation. Results are intentionally
not recorded in this draft package.

| ID | Check | Expected result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AT-01 | Run default `props` against a bundle with several concepts. | Four columns (`type`, `title`, `description`, `tags`) and one row per readable concept; rows are sorted by `concept_id`. |
| AT-02 | Select an ordered subset of supported fields. | Only selected columns appear, in requested order, in table, JSON, and CSV output. |
| AT-03 | Select an unknown field explicitly. | Command exits with a deterministic input error and does not emit a partial export. |
| AT-04 | Read concepts missing one or more approved fields. | JSON uses `null` for missing scalar values and `[]` for missing tags; table and CSV use empty cells. |
| AT-05 | Read an empty bundle. | Successful empty result includes selected columns and zero rows without crashing. |
| AT-06 | Read mixed valid, unknown-key, and malformed-but-readable frontmatter. | Readable concepts remain exported; unknown keys are not projected; tolerated issues remain visible. |
| AT-07 | Repeat the same export with filesystem entries created in different order. | Row order, field order, JSON keys, and CSV header are stable. |
| AT-08 | Compare a bundle before and after export. | No file contents, metadata, or frontmatter are changed. |
| AT-09 | Run existing focused tests plus the props suite. | Existing behavior remains green and the new regression suite passes. |

## Planned Commands and Evidence

The implementation should run the focused suite with
`python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_props.py'` and the repository
suite with `python -m unittest discover -s tests`. Run `git diff --check` and
the repository's available structural/link checks. If `pytest` is absent, use
unittest and report that fact; it is not a blocker. Record actual commands and
results before any status advances beyond draft.
