# Tasks: [FEATURE NAME]

## Execution Rules

Agents MUST execute one task at a time, keep tasks independently reviewable,
update status, and record validation evidence. Agents MUST NOT implement
future tasks or modify non-listed paths without justification.

## Status Legend

## Phase 0 — Preparation

- [ ] **T000** Read `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `acceptance-tests.md`, and
  `agent-contract.md`.
  - Done when: scope, non-goals, dependencies, and validation commands are clear.

## Phase 1 — Tests / Characterization

- [ ] **T001** Add or update tests for current behavior.
  - Paths: `[test paths]`
  - Done when: existing behavior is captured and tests pass.

- [ ] **T002** Add failing tests for the desired behavior.
  - Depends on: T001
  - Done when: failure demonstrates the specified gap.

## Phase 2 — Implementation

- [ ] **T003** Implement the specified behavior.
  - Paths: `[source paths]`
  - Depends on: T002
  - Done when: focused tests pass and invariants hold.

## Phase 3 — Validation and Closeout

- [ ] **T004** Run acceptance tests, repository checks, and `git diff --check`.
  - Depends on: T003
  - Done when: results and unresolved risks are recorded in the package log.
